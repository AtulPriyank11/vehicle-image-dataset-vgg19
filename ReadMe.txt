A readme file regarding how to setup and run the code.

1) I used Jupyter Notebook for executing the tasks that also comes from the anaconda navigator.  So Anaconda Navigator is first installed. Inside the interface, we create a new environment

so that it gets easier to install the required libraries.

2) Now, we open the anaconda prompt by giving it administrator rights and we install the exact libraries like, tensorflow, keras, numpy, matplotlib, skslearn, pandas, cv2.

For installing these we used the following: pip install (The library name) or pip3 install (The library name)

Tensorflow and keras need to have the same version so the version which I used was 2.2 for both. (pip install tensorflow==2.2.0 and pip install keras==2.2.0)

3) Then, further instructions are mentioned in the .ipynb file. 


Thank You.
